To me, "investing" in general is about sacrificing a resource in order to gain exponentially more of that or another resource. Entrepreneurs invest in a business to earn potentially more money than when working in a 9-5. We invest in people to gain friends, connections and relationships. Parents invest on their kids' 16-ish-year education. A carry hero in Dota invests in a Battle Fury so he can farm a whole lot faster mid to late game. We invest in a few extra bucks to buy food in a nearby convenience store to save time—which for me is the most valuable resource—instead of going to a supermarket where we can buy food for a lot cheaper.

In this blog's particular context, the resource we're talking about is money and we're investing in the stock market.

In my first ever investing seminar, one of the speakers said, "Sure, money can't buy you happiness—but most of the things that can, has something to do with it," and it kinda struck with me. But we're not here to define what happiness is, as it is subjective. We're just here to talk about multiplying our hard-earned cash, whichever way we want to use it.

I am starting this blog as my personal journal as I learn the ropes, become a decent stock trader & investor, and work my way towards financial freedom. I will be accumulating as much knowledge as I can—mostly about technical analysis—and post them here, making this blog somewhat of a notebook for all my learnings and experiences, good or bad.

I am NOT an expert trading guru, I am not a mentor, this is not a guide, I am not giving out stock recommendations, I got *ipit* big-time during the NOW-serye in February.

I am an unintelligent investor—at least for now.
