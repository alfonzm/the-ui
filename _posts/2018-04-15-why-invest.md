To me, "investing" in general is about sacrificing a resource in order to gain exponentially more of that or another resource. In this particular context, the resource we're talking about is money.

In my first ever investing seminar, one of the speakers said, "Sure, money can't buy you happiness—but most of the things that can, has something to do with it," and it kinda struck with me. But we're not here to define what happiness is, as it is subjective. We're just here to talk about multiplying our money, whichever way we want to use it.

I am starting this blog as my personal journal as I learn the ropes, become a decent stock trader & investor, and work my way towards financial freedom. I will be accumulating as much knowledge as I can and post them here, making this blog somewhat of a notebook for all my learnings and experiences, good or bad.

I am NOT an expert trading guru, I am not a mentor, this is not a guide, I am not giving out stock recommendations, I got *ipit* big-time during the NOW-serye in February.

I am an unintelligent investor—at least for now.
